# hw5-work-day-scheduler
Homework #5

## **Project Description**
For this project we wre tasked with creating a work day scheduler that changes colors according to what hour it currently is. We were tasked with the following assingments:
* When the page is first loaded the current day is displayed at the top of the webpage
* There are timeblocks for standard business hours
* Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or furture
* When you click the timeblock you can enter an event
* You can press the save button and that info will save to the local storage
* When the page is refreshed, the saved data persists

Here's the link to the Work Day Scheduler website: https://dylanjacobb.github.io/hw5-work-day-scheduler/
